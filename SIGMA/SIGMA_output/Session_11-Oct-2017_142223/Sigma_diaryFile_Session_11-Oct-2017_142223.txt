=======================   Informations : Initialisations    ==================
 0- Your data are located at the following path : SIGMA_data\
 1- You have selected the 3 folowing subjects : 2  3  5
 2- You have selected the 2 folowing bands : 1  2
 3- You have selected 0 for the low pass filter
 4- You have selected 0 for the notch filter
 5- You have selected 0 for the wavelet transform (reserved for the methods 25 to 35) )
 6- You have selected the 4 folowing methods : 4  5  6  7
 7- You have selected the 1  1  1  1 for applying filters for the methods : 4  5  6  7
 8- You have selected  50 feature(s) to rank with the OFR
 9- You have selected  the LDA for the classification method
======> Next Step : If you keep the default value You should run this "init_parameter=sigma_frequency_initialisation(init_parameter)"
