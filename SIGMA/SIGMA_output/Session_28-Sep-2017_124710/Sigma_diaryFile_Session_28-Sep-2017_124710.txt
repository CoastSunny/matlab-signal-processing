You should modify the parameters in this script "Sgma_parameter_initialisation" 

=======================   Informations : Initialisations    ==================
 0- Your data are located at the following path : SIGMA_data\
 1- You have selected the 3 folowing subjects : 1  2  3
 2- You have selected the 3 folowing bands : 1  2  3
 3- You have selected 0 for the low pass filter
 4- You have selected 0 for the notch filter
 5- You have selected 0 for the wavelet transform (reserved for the methods 25 to 35) )
 6- You have selected the 4 folowing methods : 1  4  5  6
 7- You have selected the 1  1  1  1 for applying filters for the methods : 1  4  5  6
 8- You have selected  50 feature(s) to rank with the OFR
 9- You have selected  the LDA for the classification method
======> Next Step : If you keep the default value You should run this "init_parameter=sigma_frequency_initialisation(init_parameter)" 
apply filter

Extract the Sampling rate from the data...


sigma_comment =

The sampling rate in this case is : 2000 Hz

=======================   Information : sigma_frequency_initialisation       ==================
0- You have selected the frquency bounds between 0.1           90Hz
1a- You have selected the following frquency bands  : 
1c- You have selected the order of  5 for the pass-band filters (band extraction)
======> Next Step : Run the Script Sigma_filter_parameter to compute the frequency filters ..."
